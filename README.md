The purpose of this softeware is to allow a quick view of your personal budget.
The idea behind this software is implement an interface for the Japanese Kakeibo method.
The word "kakeibo" can be translated as Household ledger and is literally meant
for household financial management. Kakeibos vary in structure, but the basic
idea is the same. At the beginning of the month, the kakeibo writes down the
income and necessary expenses for the beginning month and decides some kind of
savings target. The user then records their own expenses on a daily basis, which
are added together first at the end of the week and later at the end of the month.
At the end of the month, a summary of the month's spending is written in kakeibo.
In addition to expenses and income, thoughts and observations are written in kakeibo
with the aim of raising awareness of one's own consumption.
